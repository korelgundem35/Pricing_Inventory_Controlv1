# Inventory Management Reinforcement Learning Environment

This project provides customizable OpenAI Gym environments for inventory management simulations, along with utility functions and examples for reinforcement learning applications. It includes both the original environment and an alternative environment used specifically for training a PPO multi-input policy.

## Features

- **Two Environments**: Original and alternative environments for different policies.
- **Combined Algorithms**: Implementation of FQI and Pessimistic FQI algorithms.
- **Data Generation**: Scripts to generate datasets using a trained policy.
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for data processing and demand estimation.
- **Examples and Tests**: Scripts demonstrating usage and unit tests for validation.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-management-rl.git
cd inventory-management-rl
pip install -e .
